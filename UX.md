# 🧭 Telemedicine – UX Flows & Guidelines

This document explains **how UI screens are glued together** into a seamless experience.
It covers **user flows, navigation, consistency, micro-interactions, and personalization**.

---

## 1. Information Architecture (IA) & User Flows

- **Map the User Journey**

  - Patients: Onboarding → Symptom Input → Doctor List → Video Consultation → Prescriptions
  - Doctors: Onboarding → Patient Requests → Consult → History
  - Admins: Doctor Management → Medicine Stock → Reports

- **Create Sitemaps / Flow Diagrams**

  - Tools: _Miro, Figma, Whiteboarding_.

- **Prioritize Core Flows**

  - Focus on high-frequency actions first: booking a consult, seeing patients.

---

## 2. Navigation System

### Global Navigation (Persistent)

- **Navbar / Header (Patients)**

  - Logo, Home, My Consults, Find Doctors, Profile, Notifications.

- **Sidebar (Doctors/Admins)**

  - Dashboard, Patients, Appointments, Settings, Reports.

### Contextual Navigation

- **Breadcrumbs** → Multi-step flows (Onboarding, Symptom Input).
- **Tabbed Interfaces** → Multi-section screens (Prescriptions vs Records).
- **Buttons & Links** → Clear CTAs (“Book Appointment”, “Issue Prescription”).

---

## 3. Consistent UI Components & Design System

- **Unified Visual Language**

  - Colors, typography, spacing, icons → consistent brand feel.

- **Reusable Components**

  - Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, Forms, Cards, Buttons, Modals, Language Switcher.

- **Design System / Style Guide**

  - Document states & usage (e.g., Storybook, Figma Libraries).

---

## 4. Micro-interactions & Transitions

- **Loading States** → Spinners, skeleton screens.
- **Error States** → Clear, actionable messages (login failed, network error).
- **Success Feedback** → Confirmation (e.g., “Consultation Booked”).
- **Animations & Transitions** → Subtle, smooth navigation and element reveal/hide.

---

## 5. User Context & Personalization

- **Role-Based Views**

  - AuthGuard controls → show Patient, Doctor, or Admin dashboards.
  - Simplify interface per role.

- **Data Persistence**

  - Save user input + last viewed state (language, filters, last visited screen).

## Example Flow – Patient Booking a Consult

1. **Patient Onboarding Screen** → User logs in.
2. **Symptom Input & Triage Screen** → Enter symptoms, AI suggests specialization.
3. **Doctor List Screen** → Browse/filter doctors.
4. **Video Consultation Screen** → Join call.
5. **Prescriptions & Health Records Screen** → Access prescriptions.
